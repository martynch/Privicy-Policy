Introduction

Welcome to the Non-League UK website (the "Site"), provided by us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Site.

By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.

This Privacy Policy complies with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).


1. Information We Collect

1.1 Personal Information
We may collect personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that you voluntarily provide to us when you register for an account or use the Site. This may include:

Your name
Email address
Username
Profile information (e.g., profile picture)
1.2 Information from Third-Party Social Media Services

If you choose to register or log in using a third-party social media account (e.g., Apple, Google, or Facebook), we may collect information from that service, such as your name, email address, and profile picture. In this case, we do not collect or store your password.

1.3 Usage Data
We may automatically collect information about how you interact with the Site, including:

Device information (e.g., device type, operating system, unique device identifiers)
Log data (e.g., IP address, site crashes, usage times)
Analytics data (e.g., features used, time spent on the Site)
1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies
The Site may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect information and improve our services. You can manage your preferences for these technologies within your browser settings

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To provide, maintain, and improve the Site
To manage your account and provide customer support
To communicate with you about updates, promotions, or important notices
To analyze usage trends and optimize the Site's performance
To comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms and conditions

3. Password Security
If you choose to create an account directly within the Site, we will collect and store your password in a secure, hashed format. We do not store passwords in plain text, and our systems are designed to protect your credentials from unauthorized access.

Alternatively, you may choose to log in using a third-party authentication service (e.g., Apple, Google, or Facebook). In this case, we do not collect or store your password; instead, the third-party service handles your login credentials securely.

We recommend using strong, unique passwords and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) where available to further protect your account.



4. Legal Basis for Processing (UK GDPR Compliance)
Under the UK GDPR, we rely on the following legal bases to process your Personal Information:

Consent: When you voluntarily provide information, such as during registration or when using third-party login services.
Contractual Necessity: To fulfill our obligations under the terms of service you agree to when using the Site.
Legitimate Interests: To improve the Site and provide a better user experience.
Legal Obligations: To comply with applicable laws and regulations.

5. Sharing Your Information
We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties. However, we may share your information in the following circumstances:

With third-party service providers who assist us in operating the Site (e.g., hosting, analytics, customer support).
With social media platforms if you choose to log in using a third-party account.
When required by law or legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or safety.
In connection with a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.

6. Data Retention
We retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

You can delete your account and associated data at any time through the Site's user settings. Upon deletion, your Personal Information will be permanently removed from our systems, except where we are required to retain it for legal or regulatory purposes.

7. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This includes using industry-standard encryption for data transmission and secure hashing for password storage. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

8. Children's Privacy

The Site is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our servers.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us at the email address provided in the "Contact Us" section.

Rectification: Correct any inaccurate or incomplete information.
Erasure: Request deletion of your information.
